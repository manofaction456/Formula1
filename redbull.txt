            <h3><img src="max.jpg" alt="img1">Max Verstappen</a></h3>
            <p>He’s Max by name, and max by nature.
Arriving as Formula 1’s youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his car, his rivals and the sport’s record books
 to the limit. The baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the Toro Rosso – and then the Red Bull – by the horns with his 
instinctive racing style.
F1’s youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race winner – at the age of 18 years and 228 days – with an opportunistic but 
controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the 
back of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the plaudits coming.
Verstappen’s no-holds-barred attitude and hard defending have sometimes landed him in hot water with his peers and 
paymasters. But the mistakes that initially marred his potential have given way to maturity, while the bravado and energy 
that make him a blockbuster talent have remained – and the victories have kept on coming.</p>
			<h3><img src="ser.jpg" alt="img2">Sergio Perez</a></h3>
            <p>He’s the fighter with a gentle touch from the land of the Lucha Libre.
Perez’s reputation in F1 has been built on opposite approaches to Grand Prix racing. On the one hand, he is a punchy combatant who 
wrestles his way through the pack and into the points. Never afraid to add a bit of spice to his on-track encounters, even his team mates 
don’t always escape the Mexican’s heat.
Then on the other hand, Perez is a smooth operator, a master at managing tyres to eke out extra performance and give him the upper 
hand on strategy. A firm favourite on the grid after his time with Sauber, McLaren, Force India and Racing Point, Perez has matured 
into an analytical racer and team player.</p>
