            <h3><img src="carl.jpg" alt="img1">Carlos Sainz</a></h3>
            <p>He’s the matador from Madrid racing royalty. 
After entering F1’s Bull Ring paired alongside Max Verstappen at Toro Rosso in 2015, Sainz quickly showed his fighting spirit. 
A tenacious racer, he puts the car on the edge as he hustles his way through the pack. No wonder Sainz has earned the nickname Chilli.
But the Spaniard is intelligent as well as instinctive, thinking his way through a race and into the points. 
This calm temperament follows him off track where he remains unfazed by the pressures of forging a Grand Prix career with a famous name.</p>

            <p>Born in the Mediterranean idyll of Monaco, Leclerc arrived in F1 on a tidal wave of expectation. 
Practically peerless on his way to the GP3 and Formula 2 crowns, he showcased a dazzling array of skills from scorching pole positions, commanding victories – even 
when his car caught fire twice at Silverstone – to an ability to muscle his way through the pack. Winning back-to-back championships also taught Leclerc how to handle pressure, 
another useful tool in the big pond of Formula 1 racing.
Stepping up to F1 in 2018, Leclerc showed flashes of ballistic pace on Saturdays and racing brilliance on Sundays, dragging his Sauber beyond its limits – and earning himself 
a money-can’t-buy race seat at Ferrari for 2019, stepping into the shoes of the Scuderia’s last world champion, Kimi Raikkonen.</p>
