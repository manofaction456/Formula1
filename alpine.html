            <p>If there’s one man who knows how big a rollercoaster ride an F1 driver’s career can be, it’s Pierre Gasly!
The flying Frenchman was called up to make his 2017 debut in Malaysia in place of Daniil Kvyat and, after proving his mettle, 
he was named a Toro Rosso driver the following year.  A further 21 races into his fledgling career, Gasly was moved up again – this time 
to replace Red Bull big gun Daniel Ricciardo.Gasly seemed to have a knack of being in the right place at the right time – a quality that’s equally handy on track. 
A series of impressive 2018 performances for Toro Rosso – including a brilliant fourth place in Bahrain – showed exciting promise for what he might do with the ‘A’ team in 2019.</p>
			<h3><img src="est.jpg" alt="img2">Estebon Ocon</a></h3>
            <p>If there’s one word that dominates Esteban Ocon’s career, it’s ‘sacrifice’.
Back when he was just a promising karter, Ocon’s parents sold their house, put their jobs on hold, and began a life on the road, living in a caravan and travelling from circuit to circuit to 
support their son’s burgeoning career.Sacrifice, see – but it worked. 2014 saw Ocon break through in the world of single-seaters, 
as he beat a certain Max Verstappen to the European F3 title. Backed by Mercedes, he won the GP3 title the following year and was halfway through a season of DTM in 2016 when he was 
offered the chance to replace Rio Haryanto at the minnow Manor team from the Belgian Grand Prix onwards.</p>
